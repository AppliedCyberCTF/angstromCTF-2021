## Challenge

> Oh man, RSA is so cool. But I don't trust the professionals, I do things MY WAY. And I'll make my encryption EXTRA secure with an extra thicc e! You'll never crack it!

We are given `n` `e` and `c` from the RSA encryption. We can use [RsaCtfTool](https://github.com/Ganapati/RsaCtfTool) to solve this problem. It will give us the flag.
